# CS50 Code
This is a collection of the code I wrote for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) that I am proud of and was of interest to me. This was made during the [Spring 2021 session](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/).

# Using My Code
Please refer to the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) if you would like to use any of my code

# Running the Code
Much of the code unfortunately contains specific functions that can only be run in [CS50's own IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/). If you would like to run it though, simply click “Sign in with GitHub” to access the CS50 IDE and upload my code. Specific running instructions will depend on each problem/lab, but can be easily found on the instructions for each week. E.g. [week 1 problem set instructions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/psets/1/).

A majority of the C programs follow these general instructions though:
1. Open the IDE and `cd` (change directory) to the folder of the program you want to run.
    - E.g. For [`credit.c`](src/pset1/credit.c) in pset1 you would do `cd pset1`
2. Compile the program with `make program_name.c`
    - E.g. `make credit.c`
3. Run the program with `./compiled_name`
    - E.g. `./credit.c`
